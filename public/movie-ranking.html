<p>I love the fast and the furious sequal as the focus is on family. My focus is also family and not necessaily the family you are born into but the ones you choose. </p>
<h3>The Princess Diaries</h3>

<p>I love watching this movie with my daughter. It's all about reinventing yourself and becoming the best version of you. It also provides us with some quality time.</p>
<h3>Bad Boys</h3>

<p>This movie also highlights family and loyalty. Is action filled and occasionally funny.</p>
