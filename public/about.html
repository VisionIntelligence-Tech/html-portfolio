<p>With a background in healthcare and business consulting, I've always been drawn to problem-solving and finding innovative solutions. My career has been focused on helping individuals and businesses succeed, whether by setting up medical practices, streamlining workflows, or creating tailored strategies for growth. Over the years, my passion for technology has grown, leading me to explore how digital tools can enhance business efficiency and user experiences.</p>

<p>I've always had an interest in coding and technology, fascinated by how websites and applications shape the way we interact with the world. This curiosity led me to learn how to create my own webpages, combining creativity with technical skills to design functional and visually appealing sites. Teaching myself coding gave me a deep appreciation for the power of technology and how even a few lines of code can bring ideas to life.</p>

<p>Today, I specialize in web development, combining my technical expertise with a user-focused approach. My goal is to build websites that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also aligned with the needs of the people who use them. Whether it's a small business site or a personal portfolio, I bring attention to detail, a commitment to quality, and a passion for creating intuitive online experiences.</p>
